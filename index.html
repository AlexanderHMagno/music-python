    <h1>Hello Summer</h1>

    <h3 class="red"> Is this your final Project</h3>

    <p><bold>Context:</bold>  </p>
    <p><bold>Sommer</bold>: Music is dear to my heart. I enjoy playing music, composing music, and listening to music. I was initially drawn to this project through trying to describe the harmonic overtone series, mathematically. Upon looking more closely at common musical structures, I began to see how we can use concepts from this class, such set theory and graph theory, to better understand musical keys; to understand what notes go well together and what notes don’t. The idea to look at automating composition is an exploration into how we can translate musical ‘rules’ into an automatic process.

    <p><solid>Alex</solid>: On one hand, my whole life I have been intrigued with patterns, always looking for those connections that are not visible for most people. On the other hand, music is a key part of my life and I have noticed when I need to do specific activities some rhythms are more helpful than others. For this reason, I would like to explore this connection between music and math, and how, if in any melody there must be at least one pattern that repeats through the whole composition, hence, a pattern could create a melody. In discrete math we have seen that if something happens more than once it is a causality and it can be explained using different techniques.

    <h3>Question:</h3>

    How can we automate composition?
